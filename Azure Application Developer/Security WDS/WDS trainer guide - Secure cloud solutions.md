# Trainer Information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the Trainer

An amazing trainer:

- Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

- Stimulates the participant's thinking.

- Involves the participant in the learning process.

- Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

- Ensures individual participant accountability.

- Ties it all together for the participant.

- Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

- Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

- Determine your target customer audience.

- Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

- Present solution

- Respond to customer objections

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

3. As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer Scenario
The renewable energy industry is growing fast!   

Contoso Solar Inc (Contoso) is a US Domestic commercial and residential solar installation and solar technology supply firm headquartered in the Pacific NorthWest, Unitest States.    

Established 2004, by founders Susan Johnson (CEO) and Darren Cross (CFO), Contoso have almost tripled in size, and have taken on a lot of new projects that even take them from a US Domestic only operation, to an international operation with the the closing of a lucrative project from neighboring British Columbia, Canada.   This has been a long and exciting road that involved a 36 month app-modernization effort coupled with a recent lift and shift to the cloud using Azure.  This was followed again by an 18 month re-design of their key applications to take advantage of serverless deployments to take advantage of swifter time to market to accomodate the massive grwoth enjoyed industry wide.  

Now that the overall cost to install solar has dropped by almost 70% and charging and conversion efficiency has increased, the business case for solar is very hard to ignore with overall unit installation price dropping - in many cases, with components converging on commodity status.  

Contoso currently has three satellite offices, each supporting installation, fulfullment, and distribution teams:  Portland, OR, Seattle, WA, and Austin, TX.   And, as a result of their success in the industry as well as achieving GDPR/CCPA compliance including a SOC 3 certification, they will be opening a new office in Vancouver, BC to tackle the new commercial business acquired in BC which is the installation of solar for a number of provincial buildings including schools, and transit stations.   

Susan Johnson (CEO) and Darren Cross (CFO) recognize the power of Azure public cloud. 
Contoso now has most of their key line of business applications, data storage, and analysis operations on Azure.   They use M365 and each satellite office has a small on-prem compute resource used to run specific scanning and installation kitting gear.  These domains are federated using AD Connect up to the primary AAD in Aure.  Contoso currently supports direct inbound and outbound data integration with established first tier solar technology manufacturers and component suppliers located globally as well as direct integration with shippers and payment providers. 

According to Chief Information Officer (CIO) Jessica Sams, Contoso's main concern is providing **robust application security** for it's own suppliers and customers while also providing an easy online experience for them. Contoso currently manages authentication via Azure Active Directory but wants to reconfigure to support a more robust solution for 3 major user experiences:

* **B2B** - Solar Manufacturer/Providers, including professional technical contributors such as: architectural, engineering, and regulatory/legal advisors from state and local entities.   One key workflow partner of this group is Contoso's own Commercial and Residential professional installer teams as there is heavy cross-team interaction during execution of project installations.  

* **B2C** - DYI Consumers purchasing components and services directly - either wholesale or retail, and/or opting in persistent account access enabling consumer access to extended offerings provided by Contoso Consumer Services including pre- and post- sales technical support, blog access, and access to technical events sponsored by the industry

* **OPS** - Internal employee groups such as C-Suite, HR, IT, Fulfillment, Installation Teams, Partner and Consumer Services, Sales and Marketing

With these use cases and the addtion of new infrastructure, locations, and employees, Contoso needs a solution that will provide reliable authentication but in addition, they require robust account management functionality, as well as the ability to secure and audit application configuration, and integration events. 

In particular, Suppliers accessing Contoso's Supplier Workflow and APIs should only have access to resources granted to those accounts.   One Supplier should not be able to interact with allocated resources of another supplier.   

Customers purchasing from the retail website should not be able to access wholesale prices, but an OPS Contoso Sales Account Manager should be able to see both retail and wholesale information for both B2B and B2C scenarios. 

This requires a system for access and authentication that can be centrally controlled by the Contoso OPS IT Team.

In addition to Authentication and Access management (Identity), Contoso wants to ensure that their backend infrastructure use as much of the Azure backbone as possible to include direct integrations with their cloud-based CRM and ERP systems.   And of course, any APIs and Web Applications need to be secure as well, with no application secrets stored in any config or application settings so they can be managed by the security team in accordance with their InfoSec Policy. 

**Contoso IT Security Team** 

The security team is lead by Jason Ming, VP of IT Operations, who reports to Jessica Sams (CIO/DPO), and manages all operational aspects of IT infrastructure including security. 

The security team is a small cross-functional unit of DevOps-aware individuals from other teams who participate by focusing on improving full-stack security.  This is a new approach, and timely since Contoso now has executive sponsorship to invest in the next push to improve the current system architecture.   

This team manages all security aspects for the applications and users at the company, from database access all the way down to card-key access readers, and as such they want to utilize Azure to simplify and reduce management overhead for Contoso's operations to ensure a lean, mean, secure configuration.

**Contoso Development Team** 

Contoso's Development Team is headed by David Stone, Lead System Integrations and Software Engineer 
Under David's leadership, the Contoso Develpment team Team have settled on Azure DevOps as their primary CI/CD platform and the run a tight ship with a clean backlog, using a Git-Flow   

Applications are deployed using Azure DevOps Pipelines with minimal 3rd party tool interaction with the exception of some common open source testing and verification/risk management libraries.  

Their typical sprint is 7 days with trunk releases (major, minor, and patch) in a blue-green configuration every Thursday.  

### Customer Requirements
The following requirements are a result of over a year of hard work assessing Contoso's IT security requirements in order to maintain compliance with certain certifications they need to work with global providers and provide for their customers, as well as transacting with first-tier payment providers and certifcation organizations. 

Fulfiliing these requirements using robust, repeatable capabilities is essential to Contoso's continued growth and success.   Failure in any one of these areas can jeaopardize the firm's ability to maintain their current level of compliance    

**Provide Unified Identity Management Throughout the Organization â Including Partners and Consumers**
Contoso is almost completely in the Azure Cloud, with only their 3 installation warehouses with minimal on-prem compute resources, mostly to drive installation kitting automation they have in house.  All of these domains have been already federated using Azure AD Connect to their main M365 tenant.  There are two additional Azure Subscriptions:  One for development and test and the other for staging and production.

As per use cases above, there are three valid authentication scenarios:  

- **B2B** - DIY Retail Consumers should be able to use the ecommerce purchase path to purchase solar components with an anonymous cart purchase path.   Or they can create a persistent account with Contoso, using an email as username or using a social login from a valid Identity Provider, and save payment methods and view order status and order history along with sharing other social details if they desire.   This method gives them access to pre- and post- sales technical support as well as event and blog content.  

- **B2C** - DIY Retail Consumers should be able to use the ecommerce purchase path to purchase solar components with an anonymous cart purchase path.   Or they can create a persistent account with Contoso, using an email as username or using a social login from a valid Identity Provider, and save payment methods and view order status and order history along with sharing other social details if they desire.   This method gives them access to pre- and post- sales technical support as well as event and blog content.  

- **OPS** - Existing and New internal employees should be able to login with thier assigned Active Directory Work Account at work and on their devices.  Optionally this authentication flow may require multi-factor authorization (MFA).   Once authenticated, the user will experience single sign-on (SSO) behavior across enterprise applications and endpoints until they fully log out.

**Ensure Data Encryption - AT ALL TIMES (at rest and in motion)**
As Per Contoso's Infosec and Data Handling Policies, data will be encrypted throughout the application stack, regardless of location and status and this includes during application syncronization (raw data file upload/download, application data syncronization, and API transactions).  

**Provide Data Access Control based on RBAC and Identity**
As Per Contoso's Infosec and Data Handling Policies, data access controls will be applied to ensure the right data is available to the right people at the right time.  Access is controlled by role, as well as identifiers. 

Listed below is a simple data classification of Contoso secure data: 

- **Business Critical** - Client Architectural, Engineering, Requirements, or Legal and Regulatory documents uploaded by architectural firms or by state and local regulatory entities 
- **Business Critical** - ERP, Transactional Data related to Wholesale and Retail Transactions, and Service Process data classified as **Business Critical ** by Contoso
- **Business Critical** - CRM, Sales Pipeline/Biz-Dev, Supplier, and Consultative Contributor, and Persistent Retail Customer profile data
- **Mission Critical** - Post process Analysis, Poduct Definitions, Product Catalog
- **PII** - Employee HR data to include data that is considered PII by GDPR/CCPA standards

**Provide Authorization Using Role Based Access Control for Custom Applications**
As per Contoso's Infosec and Data Handling Policies, there is an active Segregation of Duties (SOD) Matrix that defines a list of roles and security groups within the company structure.   Employees should have access only to the information they need to perform their duties.  This requirement implies use of Role-based Access Control (RBAC) within the enterprise to match the SOD matrix.   

Listed below is a simple role classification for Contoso use cases: 
- **Business Admin** - C-Suite, VPs
- **HR Admin** - HR Team Members 
- **Sales** - Sales and Marketing Team members  
- **System Admin** â Configuration Team members, mapped to Azure Subscription Contributors
- **Security Admin** â Security Team members, mapped to Azure Security Owners
- **Developer** - Development Team members 
- **Developer Contractor** â All technical contractors 
- **Operations** â Office Operations, Installer Engineers, Fulfillment, Tech Support
- **External Partners** â (B2B) All external supplier and professional service partners interacting with Contoso applications 
- **External Consumer** â (B2C)This group contains all external consumers who have created accounts with Contoso for the Extended Payment, Service, and Technical Advisory Experience Contoso provides

At Contoso, all employees are allocated to roles and groups based on Employee Job Description and the SOD Matrix.  THis is the primary determinant for access to key resources, systems, and data.  

**Provide Robust Application Security Design and Deployment**

### Customer Objections

1. Restate customer objections.

### Key Design Considerations

According to David Stone, Lead System Integrations and Software Engineer, Contoso operates mostly in North American West Coast. This means that for now, performance for multiple regions takes a back seat to the more emergent application and integdration security  concerns.  The IT Group has implemented minimal cloud-based HADR, but since Contoso is growing, their IT Group will revisit these topics in the near future after the security upfit is complete.  

Nearly all of the custom applications Contoso have deployed are ASP.NET Core Web Apps and APIs or .NET Core Daemon Apps.  This is a result of a massive refactoring and tool-chain consolitation campaign started last year, uplifting their custom applications from a jungle of legacy tools and languages to a common tool-chain and language set.   This effort resulted in more predictable delivery due to reduced complexity, faster development, and greatly reduced time to market. 

All front-end APIs and Web Apps are deployed to auto-scaled app service plans.   In the near future, the Application Architecture Team is considering converting to a CQRS architecture to address scale concerns for upcoming growth by using an event/messaging, or pub-sub design pattern. 

In terms of Secure Cloud Application requirements, a few things are clear:  
1. Developers should not have direct code-level access to production application secrets
2. Applications need to be configured to authenticate with Azure services such as Azure SQL Database, and Azure Key Vault
3. Client applications will need to authenticate discreet classes of users using a unified security approach - Contoso needs a unified strategy for authentication and authorization

**NOTE**

Locking down a Secure Cloud Application Strategy is the primary concern right now however, Contoso is growing - fast - so consideration for scale and performance should be included during design.

*Requirements Recap*

### Requirement Summary

Walking through Contoso's stack with these requirements in mind, we see this solution should be a combination of:

- Securing **Azure SQL Database** using **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** and using **Always Encrypted (AE)** within client applications to ensure data is encrypted AT REST and IN MOTION.

Azure SQL Database is now provisioned with TDE enabled by default, so a proper solution will focus on the implementation of AE along with application composure of the .NET AE client libraries with Azure-managed key rotation.   

**NOTE**
We should note, that Azure SQL Database supports a BYOK option for both TDE and AE are available but for the purposes of this solution we will focus on Azure-Managed CMK as the preferred option.

- Access to sensitive data within the database is controlled by **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** that is primarily defined by the Contoso SOD Matrix, in two key ways: 

  a) Object-based access control for specific tables, stored procedures, and views via RBAC.

  b) **Row-level Security(RLS)** applied on key tables, for instance on Supplier tables, filtered by SupplierID to ensure each Supplier can only view data specific to that SupplierID.   

- Any blob storage accounts, data lake staging, or other types of raw storage should use generated **Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** with configured policies or some other form of **revokable token** for access since 3rd parties often integrate using cloud blob stores

- Applications integrate with data stores and other applications via **Azure Service Principals**

- Application connections should be configured using **SSL** and **TLS** and application secrets and other sensitive configuration information such as connection strings should be stored in **Azure Key Vault** and the application should use the appropriate .NET pre-built client libraries to retrieve this data

- Applications should require log-in through **AAD** or **Microsoft Identity Platform V2**.  Applications will compose the use of purpose-built client libraries (**ADAL** or **MSAL**) to integrate with Azure identity platform offerings, and facilitate consistent architecture and operation across the enterprise

- Contoso does use **Azure Functions** in some of their workflows, and so should be considered in the overall application security plan

## Customer quote (to be read back to the attendees at the end)

"Securing our Cloud Applications is a key initiative for this fiscal year, as our compliance levels and growth position us to take on our first international client as well as ensuring the proper security stance on custom applications and partner integrations for our existing domestic operations.   Using Azure and the Microsoft Identity Platform allows us to extend our identity and access management far beyond our existing security strategy, facilitating support for the varied identity access types for our business partners and customers."
~Jessica Sams, Chief Information Officer and Data Protection Officer, Contoso Solar, Inc.
